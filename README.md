<h1 align="center">Next Level Week, third edition, project "Happy". 🥳</h1>

<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
   <p align="center">
      The Happy project, developed during the Next Level Week, from <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/">Rocketseat</a>, from the 12th to the 18th of October.<br>
      The project is inspired by Charities, which carry out very important work in the world. And it is intended to encourage children to visit orphanages, which is a beautiful thing to see the happiness of children.<br>
      And the challenge for the week was to propose not only programming, but also a little reflection. 😀<br>
      Let's bring happiness to the world! 😊 <br>
      This event had a lot of exclusive, free content, it was simply sensational and profitable! 😄
